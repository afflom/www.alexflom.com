I've been learning about Universal Object Reference for the past two years. In that time I believe that I've developed the understanding and vocabulary needed to describe the technology in a precise and accessible way. To that end, I've created this blog to share information about UOR, related technologies, and a perspective on the implications of these technologies.

Hopefully, over the course of the subsequent posts on this blog, I'll be able to clearly communicate the profundity and practicality, as I see it, of UOR as an extensible, distributed, decentralized, attribute access controlled, semantic, stateful message bus, and resource management system. I'll discuss the implications of UOR on federated machine learning, dataset management, supply chain management, information systems management, digital identity, and other domains. In addition to this advertisement of sorts for UOR, I'll also provide demos, technical documentation, and tutorials to help readers get started with leveraging UOR concepts and technologies.

As a disclaimer, I feel obligated to share that I'm not an expert on anything. I only offer my perspective on information systems management, which is represented by UOR. Some things that I say here might seem uninformed or erroneous and I'm alright with that. I've come to believe that the crossover between information systems and metaphysics is just super difficult to talk about. Because UOR is as conceptually extensible as our own reality, I enjoy describing it from a multi-domain perspective that I find interesting, but I share at the risk of sounding naive. I'm also not a philosopher.

If you are interested in any of what I talk about here and would like to discuss it more or collaborate, please reach out. I'm always happy to discuss these concepts in individual or group settings.

Cheers,  
/Alex
